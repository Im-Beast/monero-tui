# Monero TUI

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Monero TUI is still not stable and its not recommended to use it for important transactions.\
> Consider it as being in alpha phase. Currently only Linux is supported on release builds.\
> However debug builds of macOS should work fine (except the fact that they're not signed).


Monero TUI is a terminal user interface based application to manage your Monero wallet.\
It tries to be familiar in style to the Monero GUI app.

It is written in Deno and uses FFI bindings to [monero_c](https://github.com/MrCyjaneK/monero_c/tree/master) to communcate with Monero API's.
